<!-- Hi! This is an HTML file we worked on at the Hour of Code event at Contra Costa College on December
9, 2017. I have made COMMENTS above each tag to explain them! -->

<!-- The DOCTYPE tells your browser what kind of file it's looking at. In this case, it's saying the
document type is HTML -->


<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- Every HTML documents have nested tags that look like <this>. Pretty much every tag has an opening
  tag and a closing tag that looks like </this>.  Below is the opening <html> tag. Can you find
  the closing </html> tag?  -->

<html>

<!-- Information about a web page is contained in the <head> element. Typically it's not shown
  to the user in the browser. It does contain important stuff, though, like links
  to our nifty web fonts and our CSS stylesheet. -->

  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>2017 Hour of Code -- Contra Costa College</title>

    <!-- This link is to our CSS stylesheet.  -->
